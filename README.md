# cdsre-utils

## Overview
As part of expanding my go knowledge and skills, I have created a simple utility package that I can use for day to day 
things I would normally go to the internet for.

* what's my ip address
* covert an epoch time to a human-readable time

This will be built as a cli that I can quickly run from the command line. It will be built using the cobra package.
